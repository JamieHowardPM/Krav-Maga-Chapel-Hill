          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need to be in shape before I start?</h3>
            <p>
              No. Many students begin with limited fitness or no prior training. We scale drills and intensity so you can build conditioning safely over time.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Will I be thrown into sparring right away?</h3>
            <p>
              No. Early classes focus on pad work, movement, and controlled partner drills. Higher contact work is introduced gradually and with clear consent.
